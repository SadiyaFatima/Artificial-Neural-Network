# Artificial-Neural-Network
An Artificial Neuron Network (ANN), popularly known as Neural Network is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. It is like an artificial human nervous system for receiving, processing, and transmitting information in terms of Computer Science.It is the foundation of artificial intelligence (AI) and solves problems that would prove impossible or difficult by human or statistical standards.

Basically, there are 3 different layers in a neural network :-
1.	Input Layer (All the inputs are fed in the model through this layer)
2.	Hidden Layers (There can be more than one hidden layers which are used for processing the inputs received from the input layers)

The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. But over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. ANNs have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games, medical diagnosis, and even in activities that have traditionally been considered as reserved to humans, like painting.

Components of ANNs:
1. Neurons
2. Connections and weights
3. Propagation function

Key advantages of neural Networks:
ANNs have some key advantages that make them most suitable for certain problems and situations:
1. ANNs have the ability to learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, which is really important because in real-life, many of the relationships between inputs and outputs are non-linear as well as complex.
2. ANNs can generalize — After learning from the initial inputs and their relationships, it can infer unseen relationships on unseen data as well, thus making the model generalize and predict on unseen data.
3. Unlike many other prediction techniques, ANN does not impose any restrictions on the input variables (like how they should be distributed). Additionally, many studies have shown that ANNs can better model heteroskedasticity i.e. data with high volatility and non-constant variance, given its ability to learn hidden relationships in the data without imposing any fixed relationships in the data. This is something very useful in financial time series forecasting (e.g. stock prices) where data volatility is very high.


ANNs, due to some of its wonderful properties have many applications:
1. Image Processing and Character recognition: Given ANNs ability to take in a lot of inputs, process them to infer hidden as well as complex, non-linear relationships, ANNs are playing a big role in image and character recognition. Character recognition like handwriting has lot of applications in fraud detection (e.g. bank fraud) and even national security assessments. Image recognition is an ever-growing field with widespread applications from facial recognition in social media, cancer detention in medicine to satellite imagery processing for agricultural and defense usage. The research on ANN now has paved the way for deep neural networks that forms the basis of “deep learning” and which has now opened up all the exciting and transformational innovations in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing — famous examples being self-driving cars.

2. Forecasting: Forecasting is required extensively in everyday business decisions (e.g. sales, financial allocation between products, capacity utilization), in economic and monetary policy, in finance and stock market. More often, forecasting problems are complex, for example, predicting stock prices is a complex problem with a lot of underlying factors (some known, some unseen). Traditional forecasting models throw up limitations in terms of taking into account these complex, non-linear relationships. ANNs, applied in the right way, can provide robust alternative, given its ability to model and extract unseen features and relationships. Also, unlike these traditional models, ANN doesn’t impose any restriction on input and residual distributions.

More research is going on in the field, for example — recent advances in the usage of LSTM and Recurrent Neural Networks for forecasting.

ANNs are powerful models that have a wide range of applications. Above listed are a few prominent ones, but they have far-reaching applications across many different fields in medicine, security, banking/finance as well as government, agriculture and defense.
